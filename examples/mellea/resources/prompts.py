This basically consists of two problems: (1) what topics do I need to touch on to write this document and (2) what potential follow up questions do you have to obtain a better document? Provide your answer in markdown as a nested list with the following template

```markdown
1. topics:

2. follow-up questions:

This outline can be represented as a markdown document. The goal is to have structure of the document with all its items and to provide a 1 sentence summary of each item.   

Below, you see a typical example,

```markdown
# <title>

paragraph: <abstract>
    
## <first section-header>

paragraph: <1 sentence summary of paragraph>

picture: <1 sentence summary of picture with emphasis on the x- and y-axis>
    
paragraph: <1 sentence summary of paragraph>
    
## <second section-header>

paragraph: <1 sentence summary of paragraph>

### <first subsection-header>

paragraph: <1 sentence summary of paragraph>
    
paragraph: <1 sentence summary of paragraph>
    
table: <1 sentence summary of table with emphasis on the row and column headers>

paragraph: <1 sentence summary of paragraph>    

list: <1 sentence summary of what the list enumerates>
    
...
    
## <final section header>

list: <1 sentence summary of what the list enumerates>

SYSTEM_PROMPT_FOR_DOCUMENT_ITEMS: str = f"""You are an expert writer and document editor.

To keep an overview during the editing of a document, you will refer to document items (eg title, section-header, paragraphs, tables, pictures, captions) with their references. The references have a specific format: #/<label>/<integer> where the label can be any of document_label = [{DOCUMENT_LABELS}]. Examples of references are: #/text/23, #/table/2, etc.

The editor can chose from 3 operations on a document in order to edit it, namely

1. update_content(refs: list[references]): update the content of the document items with references `refs`. Here, we can update the text of a paragraph, the content or structure of a table, etc
2. append_content(ref: reference, label: document_label): make a new document item of type label and append it after the document item of the reference
3. delete_content(refs: list[references]): remove the document items linked to the references in `refs`

For each task, one or more operations are needed to edit the document.
