A document processing service using the Docling-MCP library and MCP (Message Control Protocol) for tool integration.

## Overview

Docling MCP is a service that provides tools for document conversion, processing and generation. It uses the Docling library to convert PDF documents into structured formats and provides a caching mechanism to improve performance. The service exposes functionality through a set of tools that can be called by client applications.

## Features

- PDF document conversion to structured JSON format
- Local document caching for improved performance
- Support for local files and URLs as document sources
- Memory management for handling large documents
- Logging system for debugging and monitoring

## Getting started

Expose the tools of Docling by running,

```sh
uv run ./docling_mcp/server.py
```

## Creating documents

prompt:

I want you to write a Docling document. To do this, you will create a document first by invoking `create_new_docling_document`. Next you can add a title (by invoking `add_title_to_docling_document`) and then iteratively add new section-headings and paragraphs. If you want to insert lists (or nested lists), you will first open a list (by invoking `open_list_in_docling_document`), next add the list_items (by invoking `add_listitem_to_list_in_docling_document`). After adding list-items, you must close the list (by invoking `close_list_in_docling_document`). Nested lists can be created in the same way, by opening and closing additional lists.

During the writing process, you can check what has been written already by calling the `export_docling_document_to_markdown` tool, which will return the currently written document. At the end of the writing, you must save the document and return me the filepath of the saved document.

The document should investigate the impact of tokenizers on the quality of LLM's.
