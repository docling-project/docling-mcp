# Integrating Docling MCP into Clients

Docling MCP can be easily integrated into MCP-compatible clients using standard configuration methods.

## Claude for Desktop

[Claude for Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) supports integration via the `claude_desktop_config.json` file (located at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` in MacOS). By adding the appropriate Docling MCP endpoint and parameters to this configuration, Claude Desktop can connect to and utilize Docling MCPâ€™s functionality with minimal effort. You can find an example of those details [here](claude_desktop_config.json).

Once installed, extend Claude for Desktop so that it can read from your computer's file system, by following the [For Claude Desktop Users](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) tutorial.


## LM Studio

[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) supports MCP tools and allows to run your agentic workloads completely locally. The configuration is done by editing the `mcp.json` file, or with the convenience button below.
