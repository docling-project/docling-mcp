# Integrating Docling MCP into Clients

Docling MCP can be easily integrated into MCP-compatible clients using standard configuration methods.

For example, [Claude for Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) supports integration via the `claude_desktop_config.json` file. By adding the appropriate Docling MCP endpoint and parameters to this configuration, Claude Desktop can connect to and utilize Docling MCPâ€™s functionality with minimal effort.
